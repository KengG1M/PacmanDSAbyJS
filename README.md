# Abstract
This project focuses on developing a real-time AI pathfinder, a crucial component in some applications like gepgraphical mapping, IP routing, telephone networks,etc..

The AI, unlike a standard enemy-player tracker, will utilize various search algorithms to dynamically find the shortest path to the player, completely navigating through blocks( obstables).

Our goal is to make a pathfinder that is not only  efficient in determining the shortest path but also can be adaptable to changing target and obstacles.
## Getting Started

You can simply double click on `menu.html` or click straight to `index.html`  and use the app. 

## Why is A*?
A* is chosen for pathfinding in this scenario because it is more efficient than BFS, especially in large and complex environments. A* uses a heuristic to direct its search towards the target, leading to faster solutions. Additionally, it guarantees an optimal path if one exists, unlike BFS which is less efficient in large search spaces.
